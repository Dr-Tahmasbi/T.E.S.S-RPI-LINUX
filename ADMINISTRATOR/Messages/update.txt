Thank you for downloading TESS OS Version 8.1 STABLE.
As of version 7.0, I have added a fully functional file and DIR system to make it a fully fledged 'OS' and to make creating and managing documents easier.
There are also more games for you to enjoy, you can check these out by running the command 'Play'.
I hope you enjoy your experience with us at Tahmasbi Industries
Much Love From: Dr Tahmasbi.
